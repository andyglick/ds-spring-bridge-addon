ds-spring-bridge-addon
======================

I've been using Spring as a  DI container and Maven as a build tool
since 2004 and I have been pretty interested in at least finding out
what capabilities the JEE CDI containers might offer, so I looked for
and apparently found a competent bidirectional bridge implementation.

THIS IS SO COOL THAT I COULD START JUMPING UP AND DOWN

Anyway, the code that I found is all at least 2 years old, so many of
the library references are/were out of date, so I will be bumping all
of those and reducing the crufty technical debt.

In addition some of the logic is overly complex and could use some TLC
and the application of Java 8 simplifications with lambdas and such. And
the code isn't well tested, so there are/will be lots of fun things to
do. Voila, voila (pronounced voyla voyla, and not at all in the proper
French manner)

active work is being done, at least for now on the 1.0.0 branch, with
progress merged into master
